>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `SchedulerChangedEvent` when the Scheduler data are changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/scheduler/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EntryListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/scheduler/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)
```

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/scheduler/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which goes through `CommandManager` before being executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an entry) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.JPG" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/scheduler/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Scheduler data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyEntry>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.scheduler.commons` package.

2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.scheduler.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units 
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.scheduler.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as 
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.scheduler.logic.LogicManagerTest`
```
###### \DeveloperGuide.md

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Scheduler depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

Priority | As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can...
-------- | :-------- | :--------- | :-----------
`* * *` | new user | see usage instructions | refer to instructions when I forget how to use the App
`* * *` | user | add an event, a task and a floating task | so that I can record tasks that need to be done some day
`* * *` | user | list all items | view all entries and dates that are due sorted by date and time and know what needs to be done next
`* * *` | user | edit an item | update entries that are outdated
`* * *` | user | delete an item | remove entries that I no longer need
`* * *` | user | mark an item | distinguish completed from uncompleted items
`* * *` | user | undo an operation | have read-consistency and data changes should not be visible to queries that started running before committing them
`* * *` | user | redo an operation | commit to data changes
`* * *` | advanced user | use flexible commands | type a command faster
`* * *` | user | find an item by name | locate details of item without having to go through the entire list
`* * *` | user | path folder | specify a specific folder as the data storage location 
`* *` | user | clear all items | clear all my list in the scheduler 
`*` | user | exit the program | exit the program conveniently

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `Scheduler` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)
```

#### Use case: Path folder

**MSS**

1. User calls the path function
2. Scheduler creates a folder in specified path <br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

2a. The folder does not exist

> 2a1. Scheduler will create a folder <br>
```
###### \UserGuide.md
``` md
1. Download the latest `scheduler.jar` from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Scheduler.
3. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

###### \UserGuide.md

#### Specify a folder as data storage location: `path`
Data storage location can be manually changed to a user-specified location. User can also type `p` instead of `path`<br>
Format: `path FILE_PATH`

Examples:
* `path data/dropbox`
* `p data/dropbox`
```
